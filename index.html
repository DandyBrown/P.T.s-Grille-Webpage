        	<p>At P.T.’s Olde Fashioned Grille, we believe that food isn’t complicated. We believe in an eating experience that spends more time on consistently great flavors than trying to sell you on some arbitrary image. Today’s world is so submerged in branding and personas, making a statement, or taking a stand. We understand and provide an experience away from all that. Just a simple delicious sandwich and a kind smile.
            </p>

            <p>Here, you will find hand prepared, made to order food every day. All our sandwiches get fired up on our well-seasoned cast-iron char-grille. (No flat top here!) Our french fries are hand cut each morning, fried in a twice daily filtered canola/cottonseed oil blend. (Have no fear peanut and soy allergies!) Our produce is sourced from the freshest local vendors and everything is made with a stupid amount of love.</p>
            
            <p>You will notice our passion for the community from the moment you enter through the front doors.
            Knowing your name and your drink as well as how you like your P.T. burger is important to us.</p>
