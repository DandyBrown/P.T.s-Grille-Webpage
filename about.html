<h3>The P.T.'s Parable </h3>
	<section class="complex_grid">

	    	<p class="words">Back in the golden era of America (a.k.a. the 90’s), at the cusp of the decade, a beautiful creation emerged. P.T.’s Olde Fashioned Grille was born in 1990 as the brain child of Jeb Weinman. At that time, he saw a use for his recent begotten MBA from UNCW and a desperate need for an affordable, no frills burger spot in Wilmington. The expedition took off, quickly taking the top spot as best burger in Wilmington as voted on by residents and reported by Encore Magazine. The success continued and he was able to begin franchising, ultimately leading to 8 stores throughout North Carolina.</p>

			<p class="words">Store number 2 went up in 2003 on 17th st and added to the mystique of Wilmington’s best burger. This store is obviously the best and that’s why this website is about that one. The owner, the previous manager of the original shop, John Pointe, went on to not only continue serving great food, but created a family environment loved by both his staff and guests. The 17th st P.T.’s became something of the Island of Misfit toys as it was staffed by lonely weirdos from all over the city. Together, though, they cultivated and mastered an heir of acceptance and love for all who entered the doors. </p>

			<p class="words">All the P.T.s shops are going strong today. Together they put out the burger that wins best burger in the city every year. Oh yeah, and the fries win every year too. That’s right. This place rules. Come check it.
