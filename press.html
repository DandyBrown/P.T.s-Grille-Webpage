	    	<p>"The French fries had been seasoned with God-sent manna, and before I was even halfway done with my first order, I was contemplating ordering a second." -Rebekah Ferrell, The Seahawk  <a href="https://theseahawk.org/21548/lifestyle/review-p-t-s-olde-fashioned-grille/">See full review here!</a></p>

	    	<p>"Since these patties are as fresh as the day they are cooked, it is able to hold all the meaty flavor. It also helps that the toppings are equally as fresh as the patty and are wonderfully prepared." -Angus, Charlotte Burger Blog <a href="http://www.charlotteburgerblog.com/pts-olde-fashioned-grille/">See full review here!</a></p>
	    	<p>"Service is great, lots of employees walking around making sure you have drinks, asking if you need anything, cleaning tables and sharing smiles. I love coming here and will definitely keep coming back some more." -Hannah P., Yelp Reviewer <a href="https://www.yelp.com/biz/pts-olde-fashioned-grille-wilmington">Yelp Review Page.</a> Keeps getting better!</p><hr>


	    	<p>So as we’re taught in grade school, three is the sweet spot for supporting evidence, but we could go all day. We’re not about tooting our own horn (too much), but you can’t deny the results. P.T’s Olde Fashioned Grille is truly the best place to go if you want good food fast and at fair prices.</p>

	    	<p>If you have anything you’d like to add to our list of great reviews of if you’re one of those rare folks who thinks we could do better, please don’t hesitate to stop by, call, or email. You can find all the contact information you need below.</p>
